## Define REST API

We used https://app.swaggerhub.com to define the REST API as you can find in RESTful_API_Definition folder.

## Frontend:
	Used Technologie:
		- Vue.js: JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
			https://vuejs.org/
		- Bootstrap 4: Build responsive, mobile-first projects on the web with the worldâ€™s most popular front-end component library.
			https://getbootstrap.com/
		- vue-axios: http client library.
			https://vuejs.org/v2/cookbook/using-axios-to-consume-apis.html

	Working Environments: 
		Visual Studio Code
		Install npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
		https://github.com/creativetimofficial/vue-white-dashboard

	Cmd in the project's folder: 
		$ npm install 
			Install all the dependencies required by the template as listed in package.json file.

		$ npm run dev    OR npm run serve
			Start your local http server, open the browser and your default hosted web page will be shown.

Note: 
	The frontend is dynamic. To get the data you should run the backend first.

## Backend 

We are using flask as a python framework.

To run it:

	set FLASK_APP=server.py #in windows
	flask run
