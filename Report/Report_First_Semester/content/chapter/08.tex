\label{chap:conclusion}
We reached all main goals for the project. The best model has a decent accuracy and we have learned many things about machine learning. Through the team work with SCRUM we were able to delegate the tasks in a way, that we get the best end solution. Additionally we learned how to apply SCRUM for team work, which will help us in our further working life. All steps were necessary for the final outcome, this means we did not got stuck in a wrong direction. The project is proper documented, that a future team is able to continue with our work on the project. The biggest issues we had especially in the beginning of the project, because we did not really know how we should reach our goals or what goals we really had. For the future it would be awesome if the communication between the product owners and the students would be better. Not only in how we should start and what are the main goals, but also how the grade will be exactly built and how we have to structure the report. It would be a good way to create a one- or two-paper with all the common guidelines that the students know exactly what the product owners are require and how they will evaluate the outcome. We are not in a stage that we could actually really earn very much money with our model, which means, that we are only hardly over a 50\% accuracy. We are still have the goal to improve our model to reach higher accuracies. For the next semester the main part will be improving the model through additional features and through changing the model.
