\chapter{Evaluation}
\section{Predicting the winner}
In this phase of the CRISP-DM Process we are going to evaluate the models and the features, we previously generated.\newline
The evaluation criteria for the models and in the same way for the features which are used, is based on the test-accuracy. The highest accuracy we reached jet, have been 56.25\% with the Sliding Window Option 1, which means with the highest amount of features. The more features we have the less training samples are there for our training, so it could be better to train with more samples and less features. But because of the reason that every models are in the same range, which means there is no model which has a much smaller accuracy, it is not possible to tell the one with the highest accuracy the best model or has the best feature selection in every case. If you are using different data or a higher or smaller amount of features it could be possible to reach a better accuracy with another model than the one which reached the highest accuracy in the actual case. The first ranked model is using Keras Sequantial Neural Network, as shown in \autoref{table:coparison_of_classifiers}:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|p{2.5cm}|}
\hline

\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Model} & \textbf{Sliding Window Option} & \textbf{Parameters} & \textbf{Test-Accuracy} \\ \hline
\textbf{1} & Keras Sequential Neural Network & 3 & Hidden layers: 2 (21, 21 neurons) & 0.5625 \\ \hline
\textbf{2} & Multi-layer Perceptron & 1 & Hidden layers: 2 (52, 32 neurons) & 0.5345 \\ \hline
\textbf{3} & Decision Tree & 1 & Depth = 4 & 0.5295 \\ \hline

\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of classifiers}
\label{table:coparison_of_classifiers}
\end{table}

As you can see in the table \autoref{table:coparison_of_classifiers}, too, you can not even tell, that the more features you use, the better the outcome will be. For example with the Multi-layer Perceptron you get a worse accuracy with more features. But for the actual situation we recommend to use the first ranked model for predicting the outcome for football games, but we will maybe use a different model with other features in the future.

\subsection{Comparing Regression with Multi Class Classification}
As it is described before the Multi Class Classification has still many possibilities to improve, so in this point we only compare the actual model with the best regression model. For this we will use our own Quality Criteria, but as it is described in the part `Quality Criteria', this has some disadvantages and has to be improved in the future. Because of this, the test accuracy is also used for the comparison. For the Multi Class Classification approach we are reaching a test accuracy of 30.54\% for the away team and 37.64\% for the home team, which makes an average of 34.09\%. With the regression model we are reaching a test accuracy of [HEMI U HAVE TO FILL IN]. Using our quality criteria we are reaching and average of  80.38\% (77.30\% for the home team and 83.47\% for the away team) with the Multi Class Classification and [HEMI U HAVE TO FILL IN] with the regression approach. Because of the better results with the regression model the team decided to use this model for the homepage. After improving the regression and the Multi Class Classification this could change.
